    npm install
    ```

3.  Set up your environment variables:
    Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory and add the following:

    ```
    MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
    JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
    REDIS_HOST=localhost
    REDIS_PORT=6379
    JUDGE0_API_URL=your_judge0_api_endpoint
    ```

**Running the Application**

1.  Start the Redis and MongoDB services.

2.  Start the backend server:

    ```bash
    # From the backend directory
    npm start
    ```

3.  Start the frontend development server:
